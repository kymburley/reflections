What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git initializes an empty repository in the directory I was located. It needs to
be done to start controlling the versions of my documents.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where your files go before they are committed. The working
directory is where the file is located on your harddrive. The repository is
where files are that have been committed. The value of the staging area is that
your files go there before committing, but if you change your mind and don't
want to commit you can reverse the file out. By doing this the file is never
committed.
