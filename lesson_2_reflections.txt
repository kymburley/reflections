What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git initializes an empty repository in the directory I was located. It needs to
be done to start controlling the versions of my documents.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where your files go before they are committed. The working
directory is where the file is located on your harddrive. The repository is
where files are that have been committed. The value of the staging area is that
your files go there before committing, but if you change your mind and don't
want to commit you can reverse the file out. By doing this the file is never
committed.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

When you don't want to make a permanent change to the program - if you're trying
out new features or want to do a demo with new features. You can make these
types of changes on a branch so you can still run the program without over-
writing the codebase.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Because it's easy to see which commits are on which branch, and also, which
commits are unreachable.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The result is the master branch has all of the commits in both branches. We
represent it in the diagram the way we do so we have a visual of the branches
and what our intended result is with the merge.
