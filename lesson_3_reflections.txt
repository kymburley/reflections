When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would create a remote repository when I want to collaborate or share my files
with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Git may stay up-to-date at inopportune times. It seems to me that it is always
best to pull changes manually so you can control when those changes are synced.
